This is a leaf classifier project I did

A description of the project on Kaggle can be found here:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification

My classifier, which is a deep neural network, achieved 94% accuracy on the test set of leafs

I do not recommend cloning this repository because it has a lot of large image files

Instead, just look at my LeafClassifier.py and LeafClassifierDropout.py, my two implementations with and without dropout.
